# javaswing-battleships
Overview

This project is my implementation of a classic Battleships game, which I have developed using Java. The game implements a GUI built with Java Swing. The game allows a person to play a game of Battleships in 3 different modes: Human vs Human, Human vs Computer and Computer vs Computer (this can be changed in the GameLauncher inside of the Java file), this provides an interactive gameplay through a desktop GUI. This project emphasises object oriented programming and Swing to handle user interaction and provide visual feedback.

Features
-Swing based GUI
-Multiple gameplay modes
-Multiple ship types (Battleship, Aircraft Carrier, Destroyer, Submarine, Aeroplane)
